<p><b>Astronauts orbiting the Earth are drilled to deal with the worst possible scenarios. That includes having to leave a doomed space station – quickly.</b></p>
    <p>On Thursday (15 January), the four astronauts who made up Crew-11 
    on the International Space Station (ISS) splashed down in the Pacific Ocean. 
    One of the four crew members had reported a medical emergency 
    which couldn't be treated with the space station's modest resources. Instead, they had to evacuate.</p>

    <p>America's Mike Fincke and Zena Cardman, Japan's Kimiya Yui and cosmonaut Oleg Platonov had arrived in August 2025 and planned to stay the standard six-and-a-half months on the station. But the medical emergency necessitated the entire crew coming back together on the SpaceX-made capsule that had delivered them to the ISS.</p>

    <p>The incident shows human exploration of the Solar System, 
        even in low orbit, can never be considered routine. 
        "Space," said Dr McCoy in a recent iteration of Star Trek,
        "is disease and danger, wrapped in darkness and silence". 
        And that is on a good day.<br>Imagine being woken by a persistent blaring siren. 
        Disorientated, you are sealed in your sleeping bag in a tiny space station cabin. 
        The oxygen is being sucked away through a hole in the wall 
        punctured by space debris, or maybe toxic ammonia is seeping into the air around you.
        Perhaps flames are licking at the doorway.</p>

    <p>If you are a trainee astronaut,
     you don't have to imagine any of these things – you will have experienced every one of them
      – and possibly all at once – many times in an International
       Space Station (ISS) simulator on the ground.</p>

    <p>"They'll throw you in the deep end," says Meganne Christian. 
       She is the senior exploration manager at the UK Space Agency,
        Christian is also in training as a reserve astronaut
        for the European Space Agency (Esa).</p><br>
    <br>"They won't tell you what's going to happen – for example, fires, ammonia leaks, all sorts of different things and you 
         just have to deal with them," Christian says. "It's designed to be a situation that will never happen, fingers crossed, 
         but it's really to get you ready for the idea that 
         lots of things could happen at once and you have to be able to make decisions on your feet."
